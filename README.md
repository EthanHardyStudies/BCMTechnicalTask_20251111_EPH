### Task Overview

You are tasked with creating a basic credit risk management application. This application should evaluate customer credit scores and generate alerts for high-risk customers. Please upload to a public github repo and send me the link.s

### Requirements

#### 1\. Input Data

- A list of customers, each with the following properties:
    
    - **CustomerId** (integer)
        
    - **Name** (string)
        
    - **PaymentHistory** (percentage of payments made on time, 0 to 100)
        
    - **CreditUtilization** (percentage of credit limit used, 0 to 100)
        
    - **AgeOfCreditHistory** (in years)
        

#### 2\. Features

##### a. Calculate Credit Score

Implement a method to calculate a credit score for each customer using the following formula:

**CreditScore = (0.4 _ PaymentHistory) + (0.3 _ (100 - CreditUtilization)) + (0.3 \* Min(AgeOfCreditHistory, 10))**

- The score should be an integer.
    

##### b. High-Risk Customers

Identify customers with a credit score below 50. These are considered "high risk."

##### c. Output Reports

- Generate a summary report listing each customer's name, credit score, and risk status (High Risk or Low Risk).
    
- Log the report to the console.
    
- Write unit tests for the `CalculateCreditScore` method.
    
- Save the report to a JSON file.
    

### Deliverables

- A .NET Console Application (or .NET Core) that fulfills the above requirements.
    
- Source code with clear comments.
    
- (Optional) A test project with at least one unit test.
    

### Evaluation Criteria

1. **Code Quality**:
    
    - Readability, structure, and use of best practices.
        
2. **Correctness**:
    
    - Accurate implementation of the credit score formula and risk assessment.
        
3. **Edge Cases**:
    
    - Handling of invalid or out-of-range input values.
        
4. **Bonus Features**:
    
    - Implementation of unit tests and report saving.
